My interest in AI began about a year ago, inspired by ChatGPT and a video by Google’s machine learning research team about a model for detecting cancerous cells.\n\n\nI aspire to work in the field of AI/ML. Many people don’t realize that AI and Data Science are closely related, with AI often considered a subset of Data Science. Before diving into models and algorithms, it’s crucial to understand data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization.
