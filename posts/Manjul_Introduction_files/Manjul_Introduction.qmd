### Why Software?
#### High Demand and Security

Initially, I was solely a Software Engineering major, but I declared my minor in Data Science last fall. My interest in AI began about a year ago, inspired by ChatGPT and a video by Google's machine learning research team about a model for detecting cancerous cells.

### Future Plans
I aspire to work in the field of AI/ML. Many people don't realize that AI and Data Science are closely related, with AI often considered a subset of Data Science. Before diving into models and algorithms, it's crucial to understand data preprocessing, data visualization, feature engineering, statistics, etc. These skills are essential for building better models.

### My Skills and Objectives
#### Personal Strengths
- **Good communicator:** An essential skill in any sector.
- **Adaptability:** I am a quick learner.
- **Open-mindedness:** Being open-minded helps me adapt, learn, and grow in my field.

#### Data Science Skills
- Experience with data preprocessing
- Fundamental knowledge of machine learning and deep learning
- Proficiency in multiple programming languages, frameworks, and tools

#### Goals at DSPG
- **Data Visualization:** Mastering tools like seaborn, matplotlib, and Tableau, and understanding the significance of various graphs.
